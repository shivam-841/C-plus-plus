//the following code will be changed before the compiler starts to
//compile it:
#define NUMBER 41
int main() {
 int a = NUMBER + 1;
 return 0;
}

//Everything that is defined using the #define directive is called a macro. After
//preprocessing, the compiler gets the transformed source in this form:
int main() {
 int a = 41 + 1;
 return 0;
 }
 
 //It is strongly suggested to use const declarations instead of macro definitions wherever
//applicable.Search why const is better than define or enum!
